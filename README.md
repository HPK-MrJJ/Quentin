A discord bot that does various things I want it to do.


The Docket Updates cog gives me periodic updates in my personal server when court dockets I'm following are updated. It polls the CourtListener API, which is pretty inefficient. I've since upgraded my personal set up to use the webhooks, but I feel like keeping this one here. Maybe I'll put my new code on here, maybe not. The only reason I put these on Github is because it's an easy way to a custom cog into redbot.

The Name Finder cog gives me periodic updates in my personal server with new names that become available on NS. It does not currently work and I dont have plans to make it work at this point.

The puppet tracker cog will sometime use NS daily updates to make sure my puppets are where they should be. Obviously I haven't really started on that.
