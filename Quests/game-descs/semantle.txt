Well, lonely <@&879922862876672000>ers, welcome to hell.

Also known as Semantle, a game where you guess a daily word based off of how close your guesses are to that daily word in meaning.

It is a grueling effort, at least for me and most normal people i've talked to, but DKP will be awarded accordingly.

Here is the link - https://semantle.com/

3 DKP for playing (even if you give up)
7 DKP for getting the word
15 DKP for getting the word in less than fifty tries
20 DKP for getting it in the least amount of tries (you can't get both the 15 DKP and 20 DKP ones)

Post your :sob: and score in #return-quest
