We are playing the NYT spelling bee game today. So buckle up and get ready to make words that are at least four letters long out of a bucket of seven letters where you have to use the middle letter in the bucket in every word.

There are different tiers of scores depending on how many words you find.

3 DKP for playing
5 DKP for getting "Nice" aka 29 points
10 DKP for getting "Genius" or the highest score

paste your scores into #return-quest as always.
