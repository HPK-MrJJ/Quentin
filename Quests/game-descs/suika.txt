**SUIKA GAME TIME**

Suika game is a game where fruits fall from the sky. If two fruits of the same type touch, they combine into a higher level fruit and your score increases. There's a barrier to how high your pile of fruits can go, though, so watch out for that!

Submit your highest-level fruit in the next 24 hours in ‚Å†return-quest for some DKP!

1 DKP for reaching Peach
3 DKP for reaching Pineapple
5 DKP for reaching Melon
7 DKP for reaching chim (Watermelon)

Protip: Your highest fruit is not recorded, but it's what you'll be graded on. You might consider screenshotting every time you unlock a new fruit so you don't lose your submission. If you forget and a fruit crosses the rainbow boundary, you'll have a couple seconds to screenshot when the fruit over the line flashes red.
