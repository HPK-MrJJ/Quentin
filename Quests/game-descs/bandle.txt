<@&879922862876672000> Bandle time yay! Wednesday is the day for word games except when it isn't!

Bandle! First you hear the drums of a popular song, then the drums and the bass, then the drums, the bass and the guitar... Try and guess the song with as few layers of instruments as possible. Submit your results in ‚Å†#return-quest !

1 DKP for finishing the game
2 DKP for correctly guessing the song in 5 or fewer guesses
3 DKP for correctly guessing the song in 3 or fewer guesses
